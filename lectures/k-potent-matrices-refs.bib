abstract = {Let A be a square matrix that is diagonalizable. We find all the commuting solutions of the quadratic matrix equation AXA=XAX, by taking advantage of the Jordan form structure of A, together with the help of a well-known theorem on the uniqueness of a solution to Sylvester’s equation. Two special classes of the given matrix A are further investigated, including circular matrices and those that are equal to some of their powers. Moreover, all the non-commuting solutions are constructed when A is a Householder matrix, based on a spectral perturbation result.}
