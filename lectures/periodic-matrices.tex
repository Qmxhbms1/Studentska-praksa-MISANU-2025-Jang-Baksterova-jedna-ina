\section{Preliminary results}

\begin{theorem} \label{diagonalizable}
  A linear operator $A$ on a vector space $V$ of dimension $n$ over the field $\C$ is diagonalizable if and only if the minimal polynomial of $A$ has no repeated roots.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{minimalpoly}
  Every annihilating polynomial is the multiple of the minimal polynomial of an operator $A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{solutions}
  Suppose that $A$ is an $n \times n$ complex diagonalizable matrix with three distinct eigenvalues $0, \lambda$ and $\mu$ with $\lambda \mu \neq 0$ and $\lambda^2 - \lambda \mu + \mu^2 \neq 0$.
  Then all solutions of the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation $A X A = X A X$ have the form
  \[X = S \begin{bmatrix} P & 0 & 0\\ 0 & Q & 0\\ 0 & 0 & I_{n - m} \end{bmatrix} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|ccc|c} \widehat{\lambda} I_r & 0 & 0 & F & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda I_v & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0_{k - r - v} & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_3 \\ \hline G & 0 & 0 & \widehat{\mu} I_r & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \mu I_t & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_{m - k - r - t} & C_6 \\ \hline 0 & 0 & D_3 & 0 & 0 & D_6 & W \\ \end{array} \right] \begin{bmatrix} P^{-1} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & Q^{-1} & 0\\ 0 & 0 & I_{n - m} \end{bmatrix} S^{-1},\]
  in which,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $P \in \C^{k \times k}, Q \in \C^{(m - k) \times (m - k)}$ are any invertible matrices, 
    \item $0 \le r \le \min \{k, m - k\}$, $0 \le v \le k - r$, $0 \le t \le m - k - r$, 
    \item $\widehat{\lambda} = \frac{\mu^2}{\mu - \lambda}, \widehat{\mu} = \frac{\lambda^2}{\lambda - \mu}$,
    \item $F$ is an arbitrary $r \times r$ invertible matrix, 
    \item $G = \frac{- \lambda \mu (\lambda^2 - \lambda \mu + \mu^2)}{(\lambda - \mu)^2} F^{-1}$, 
    \item $C_3 \in \C^{(k - r - v) \times (n - m)}$, 
    \item $C_6 \in \C^{(m - k - r - t) \times (n - m)}$, 
    \item $D_3 \in \C^{(n - m) \times (k - r - v)}$, 
    \item $D_6 \in \C^{(n - m) \times (m - k - r - t)}$, 
    \item $\lambda D_3 C_3 = - \mu D_6 C_6$, 
    \item $W$ is an arbitrary $(n - m) \times (n - m)$ matrix.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{similarity}
  If $A = Q^{-1} J Q$ and $Y$ is a solution of the equation $J Y J = Y J Y$, then $X = Q^{-1} Y Q$ is a solution to the equation $A X A = X A X$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Core-Nilpotent Decomposition] \label{core-nilpotent}
Let $A$ be a square matrix of size $n \times n$ with complex entires. Let $k = \mathrm{ind}(A)$ be the index of $A$, and let $r = \mathrm{rank}(A^k)$. Then there exists a non-singular matrix $Q$ such that
\[
Q^{-1}AQ = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    L & 0 \\
    0 & C
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $C$ is an $r \times r$ invertible matrix, and $L$ is an $(n-r) \times (n-r)$ nilpotent matrix of index $k$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{invertible}
  Let $A$ be a regular matrix then all nonzero commuting solutions to $A X A = X A X$ are provided via the formula
  \[X_c = \frac{1}{2} \bigl( A + (A^2)^{1/2} \bigl),\]
  where $(A^2)^{1/2}$ is any square root of the matrix $A^2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{Sylverster-equation}
  The equation $AX - XB = C$ has a unique solution $X$ if and only if $\sigma (A) \cap \sigma (B) = \emptyset$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem} \label{generating-solutions}
  For a given matrix $A \in M_n (\C)$, let $X_0 \in S$ and let $f, g$ be well defined functions in $\sigma (A)$ such that
  \[g(A) A f(A) = A.\]
  Then $f(A) X_0 g(A) \in S$.
  A function is well defined if the values $f^{(j)} (\lambda_i), j = 0, 1 \ldots n_i - 1, i = 1, 2 \ldots s$, where $n_i$ is the size of the largest Jordan block in which $\lambda_i$ appears and $s$ is the number of distinct eigenvalues.
\end{theorem}

\section{All solutions for $A^3 = -A$}

\begin{theorem} \label{periodic-diagonal}
  For any $n \in \N$ and $t \in \C$, the matrix $A$ satisfying $A^n = t A$ is diagonalizable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Consider the polynomial $p(x) = x^n - t x$.
  It is clear that any $A$ such that $A^n = t A$ annihilates this polynomial, thus by Theorem \ref{minimalpoly}, it is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.
  The polynomial has $n$ distinct roots, $x = 0$ and $x^{n - 1} = t$.
  Thus the roots of the minimal polynomial must also be distinct, i.e., have the multiplicity equal to 1.
  Applying Theorem \ref{diagonalizable} we get that $A$ is diagonalizable.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  If $A^3 = -A$, assume that the rank of $A$ is $m$ and the multiplicity of eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ is $k$.
  Then all solutions of the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation $A X A = X A X$ have the form
  \[X = S \begin{bmatrix} P & 0 & 0\\ 0 & Q & 0\\ 0 & 0 & I_{n - m} \end{bmatrix} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|ccc|c} - \frac{i}{2} I_r & 0 & 0 & F & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & i I_v & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0_{k - r - v} & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_3 \\ \hline - \frac{3}{4} F^{-1} & 0 & 0 & \frac{i}{2} I_r & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & - i I_t & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_{m - k - r - t} & C_6 \\ \hline 0 & 0 & D_3 & 0 & 0 & D_6 & W \\ \end{array} \right] \begin{bmatrix} P^{-1} & 0 & 0\\ 0 & Q^{-1} & 0\\ 0 & 0 & I_{n - m} \end{bmatrix} S^{-1},\]
  in which, $P \in \C^{k \times k}, Q \in \C^{(m - k) \times (m - k)}$ are any invertible matrices, $0 \le r \le \min \{k, m - k\}, 0 \le v \l k - r, 0 \le t \le m - k - r$, $F$ is an arbitrary $r \times r$ invertible matrix, $C_3 \in \C^{(k - r - v) \times (n - m)}$, $C_6 \in \C^{(m - k - r - t) \times (n - m)}$, $D_3 \in \C^{(n - m) \times (k - r - v)}$, $D_6 \in \C^{(n - m) \times (m - k - r - t)}$, $i D_3 C_3 = i D_6 C_6$, and $W$ is an arbitrary $(n - m) \times (n - m)$ matrix.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By Theorem \ref{periodic-diagonal} we know that $A$ is diagonalizable and that its eigenvalues are in the set $\{0, i, - i\}$.
  We easily check that $i^2 - i (- i) + (- i)^2 = -3 \neq 0$.
  Applying Theorem \ref{solutions} we get our result.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
This trivially generalizes for the case of $A^3 = t A$ for any $t \in \C$.
\end{remark}

\section{Some solutions for $A^n = A^2$}
\begin{theorem} \label{singular}
  If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then all nontrivial commuting solutions to Yang-Baxter-like matrix equations are singular.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  It is easy to show that if we assume $X$ to be a commuting solution, the the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation is equivalent to the equation $AX = X^2 = XA$.
  If $X$ is invertible, it follows that $AX = X^2$ implies $A = X$.
  Therefore we know that if $X \neq A$ is a commuting solution to the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation, then $X$ must be singular.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}
  Here we present a way of generating families of solutions of the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equations for the case that $A^n = A^2$.

  We begin by decomposing our matrix $A$ into a block diagonal form using Theorem \ref{core-nilpotent}.
  Any solution found for this new matrix will yield a solution for $A$ by Theorem \ref{similarity}, thus we will simply refer to our decomposed matrix as $A$.
  Notice that since the minimal polynomial of $A$ divides $m_A(x) = x^2 (x^{n - 2} - 1)$ our nilpotent matrix, $A_1$ will have a nilpotency index 2, and our invertible matrix $A_2$ will be a diagonalizable matrix.
  Since $A_2$ is diagonalizable, we can simply use Theorem \ref{similarity} and assume that it is diagonal.
  We put
  \[X = \begin{bmatrix} X_1 & X_2\\ X_3 & X_4 \end{bmatrix}.\]
  Then, multiplying out $A X A = X A X$ we get the following system of equations:
  \[\begin{cases}
    A_1 X_1 A_1 = X_1 A_1 X_1 + X_2 A_2 X_3\\
    A_1 X_2 A_2 = X_1 A_1 X_2 + X_2 A_2 X_4\\
    A_2 X_3 A_1 = X_3 A_1 X_1 + X_4 A_2 X_3\\
    A_2 X_4 A_2 = X_3 A_1 X_2 + X_4 A_2 X_4
  \end{cases}\]
  From here we consider multiple cases.

  \begin{case}[$X_2 = X_3 = 0$]
    Our system of equation reduces to two Yang-Baxter-like matrix equations, one for the nilpotent matrix $A_1$ and one for the invertible matrix $A_2$.
    All of the solutions for the nilpotent matrix with a nilpotency index 2 have been found in the paper D. Zhou and J. Ding, \textit{All solutions of the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation for nilpotent matrices of index two}.
    Using Theorem \ref{invertible} we can find all the commuting solutions for $A_2$.
    It is easy to check that all solutions for this case will be commuting.
  \end{case}

  \begin{case}[$X_3 = 0, X_2 \neq 0$]
    Here our system simplifies to
    \[\begin{cases}
      A_1 X_1 A_1 = X_1 A_1 X_1\\
      A_1 X_2 A_2 = X_1 A_1 X_2 + X_2 A_2 X_4\\
      A_2 X_4 A_2 = X_4 A_2 X_4
    \end{cases}\]
    Again, we can use Theorem \ref{invertible} to find all commuting $X_4$.
    We will choose a singular $X_4$ which we know exists by Theorem \ref{singular}.
    Since $A_1$ is singular, we know that there exist infinitely many matrices such that $X_1 A_1 = 0$, and they all clearly provide a solution to the first equation.
    If we fix such an $X_1$, the second equation reduces to the following:
    \[A_1 X_2 - X_2 A_2 X_4 A_2^{-1} = 0.\]
    This is a Sylverster equation with a trivial solution $X_2 = 0$.
    Since $X_4$ is singular so is $A_2 X_4 A_2^{-1}$ as eigenvalues are invariant under change of basis.
    Clearly $A_1$ is singular since it is nilpotent.
    Thus their spectra have a nonempty intersection, as $0$ is an eigenvalue of both matrices since they are singular.
    Hence, by Theorem \ref{Sylverster-equation} it follows that $X_2 = 0$ is not a unique solution.
    It is possible to construct all of the solutions for this Sylverster equation, giving us another family of solutions for the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation.
    It is easy to check that as long as $X_2 \neq 0$ these solutions are all non commuting.
  \end{case}

  \begin{case}[$X_2 = 0, X_3 \neq 0$]
    This case is analogous to the previous one with a few changes.
  \end{case}

  \begin{case}[$X_2 \neq 0, X_3 \neq 0$]
    The solution for this would require solving the full system which is currently too difficult.
    However, such solutions can exist in general, take
    \[A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}, X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 2\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 3 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.\]
    It is simple to check that $A^4 = A^2$ and that $A X A = X A X$.
  \end{case}
\end{algorithm}

  Since we have found non commuting solutions to the Yang-Baxter-like matrix equation we can use Theorem \ref{generating-solutions} to perhaps find more solutions.
  Note that $f(A)$ and $g(A)$ must be block diagonal matrices.
  Just take $A$ in its Jordan Normal Form and apply the core-nilpotent decomposition.
  This leaves us with a matrix block of Jordan zero blocks and a matrix block of Jordan blocks for non-zero eigenvalues.
  Then, $f(A)$ consists precisely of matrices $f(A_1)$ and $f(A_2)$ on its diagonal.
  Thus we can write
  \[f(A) = \begin{bmatrix} F (A_1) & 0\\ 0 & F (A_2) \end{bmatrix}, g(A) = \begin{bmatrix} G (A_1) & 0\\ 0 & G (A_2) \end{bmatrix}.\]
    Since the solutions we have found are block upper (or lower) triangular it is easy to see that
  \[f(A) X g(A) = \begin{bmatrix} F (A_1) X_1 G (A_1) & F (A_1) X_2 G (A_2)\\ 0 & F (A_2) X_4 G (A_2) \end{bmatrix}.\]
  Thus we certainly cannot generate all solutions starting from this as our non commuting solution.

\begin{remark}
  This methodology for generating solutions can be easily generalized to the arbitrary case of a singular non-nilpotent matrix.
  The noncommuting solutions remain the same, while for commuting solutions we become limited to only the zero divisors of $A_1$, since the general nilpotent case is still open.
\end{remark}
