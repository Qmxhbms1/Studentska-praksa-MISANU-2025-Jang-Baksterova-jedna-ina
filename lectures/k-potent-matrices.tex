\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{The Core Problem}
  We investigate the Yang-Baxter-like Matrix Equation (YBME):
  \begin{block}{The YBME}
  \[ AXA = XAX \]
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is a non-linear matrix equation with $n^2$ quadratic equations and $n^2$ variables.
    \item Finding all solutions in general is an open and difficult problem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation: Why Study This Equation?}
  While the equation $AXA=XAX$ is simple to write down, it is a gateway to deep mathematical concepts.
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{A Gateway to Quantum Physics:} It is a "classical" or "set-theoretic" version of the celebrated \textbf{Quantum Yang-Baxter Equation} (QYBE).
    \[ R_{12} R_{13} R_{23} = R_{23} R_{13} R_{12} \]
    \item \textbf{Foundations of Modern Physics:} The QYBE is a cornerstone of quantum integrable systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum field theory.
    \vfill
    \item \textbf{Connections to Topology:} Solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation can be used to construct invariants of knots and links, forming a bridge between algebra and low-dimensional topology.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  \begin{alertblock}{Our Goal}
  By studying the simpler matrix equation, we develop tools and intuition for these more complex and significant problems.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our Strategy: Add Structure}
  A powerful method in mathematics is to simplify a problem by imposing additional constraints.
  \vfill % Adds vertical space
  \begin{alertblock}{Our Guiding Constraint}
  We will classify solutions where the matrix $A$ has a "generalized periodicity":
  \[ A^k = tA \]
    for an integer $k \ge 2$ and a scalar $t \in \mathbb{C}$.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\section{Theoretical Foundations}

\begin{frame}{The Starting Point: Annihilating Polynomials}
  Our entire strategy begins with finding a polynomial that a matrix satisfies.
  \begin{definition}
    An \textbf{annihilating polynomial} for a matrix $A$ is any non-zero polynomial $p(x)$ such that $p(A) = 0$.
  \end{definition}
  \vfill
  A fundamental result guarantees that such a polynomial always exists.
  \begin{theorem}[Cayley-Hamilton Theorem]
    Every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. That is, if $p_A(x) = \det(xI - A)$ is the characteristic polynomial of $A$, then $p_A(A) = 0$.
  \end{theorem}
  \vfill
  So, the characteristic polynomial is always an annihilating polynomial.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Superior Tool: The Minimal Polynomial}
  The characteristic polynomial is useful, but it is not always the most efficient tool. We want the annihilating polynomial of the \textit{lowest possible degree}.
  \begin{definition}
    The \textbf{minimal polynomial} $m_A(x)$ of a matrix $A$ is the unique monic polynomial of lowest degree that annihilates $A$.
  \end{definition}
  \vfill
  It is the true "genetic code" of the matrix, and it has a crucial relationship with all other annihilating polynomials.
  \begin{theorem}
    The minimal polynomial $m_A(x)$ divides every annihilating polynomial of $A$ (including the characteristic polynomial).
  \end{theorem}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Goal: Diagonalizability}
  The key structural property we want to establish is diagonalizability, as it simplifies the YBME immensely.
  \begin{definition}
    A matrix $A$ is \textbf{diagonalizable} if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, i.e., there exists an invertible matrix $P$ such that $A = PDP^{-1}$.
  \end{definition}
  \vfill
  The minimal polynomial provides a direct and powerful criterion for determining this.
  \begin{theorem}[The Main Criterion]
    A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots (i.e., its roots are distinct).
  \end{theorem}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Our Strategy Synthesized}
  These theorems provide a clear, step-by-step strategy to analyze the structure of $A$ from the condition $A^k=tA$.
  \begin{alertblock}{The Strategic Framework}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Find Annihilator:} The condition $A^k=tA$ means $A$ is annihilated by the polynomial $p(x) = x^k - tx$.
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Check Roots:} Factor $p(x)$ and check if its roots are distinct.
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Constrain Minimal Poly:} Since $m_A(x)$ must divide $p(x)$, if $p(x)$ has distinct roots, then $m_A(x)$ must also have distinct roots.
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Conclude Diagonalizability:} By the main criterion, if $m_A(x)$ has distinct roots, then the matrix $A$ must be diagonalizable.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{alertblock}
  This logical chain is the engine that drives the first half of our analysis.
\end{frame}

\section{The Foundational Case: $A^3 = -A$}

\begin{frame}{The Foundational Case: $A^3 = -A$}
  This corresponds to our constraint with $k=3$ and $t=-1$.
  \vfill
  The matrix $A$ must be a root of the polynomial:
  \[ p(x) = x^3 + x = 0 \]
  \vfill
  \textbf{The Key Insight:} The properties of $A$ are encoded in this polynomial.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Key Tool: The Minimal Polynomial}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The minimal polynomial of $A$, denoted $m_A(x)$, must divide any annihilating polynomial.
    \item Therefore, $m_A(x)$ must divide $p(x) = x^3 + x$.
    \pause % This is an overlay! The next part will appear on the next click.
    \item Let's factor our polynomial:
    \[ p(x) = x(x^2 + 1) = x(x-i)(x+i) \]
    \pause
    \item The roots are $\{0, i, -i\}$. They are distinct.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Diagonalizability}
  We now use a fundamental theorem of linear algebra.
  \begin{theorem}
    A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots.
  \end{theorem}
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since the roots of $p(x)$ are distinct, the roots of $m_A(x)$ must also be distinct.
    \pause
    \item \textbf{Conclusion:} Any matrix $A$ satisfying $A^3 = -A$ \textbf{must be diagonalizable}.
    \item Its spectrum (set of eigenvalues) must be a subset of $\{0, i, -i\}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Applying this to the YBME}
  Now we can solve our original problem for $A^3 = -A$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We proved $A$ is diagonalizable with spectrum $\subseteq \{0, i, -i\}$.
    \item A known theorem provides all YBME solutions for matrices with a spectrum $\{0, \lambda, \mu\}$, provided a condition holds. \cite{tripotent}
    \pause
    \item \textbf{The Condition:} $\lambda^2 - \lambda\mu + \mu^2 \neq 0$.
    \pause
    \item \textbf{Our Check:}
    \[ (i)^2 - (i)(-i) + (-i)^2 = -1 - 1 - 1 = -3 \neq 0 \]
    \item The condition holds. Therefore, we can substitute $\lambda=i, \mu=-i$ into the known general solution to get our answer.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Explicit Solution for $A^3 = -A$}
  By substituting $\lambda=i, \mu=-i$ into the general form, we get all solutions $X$:
  \begin{block}{The General Form of $X$}
  % We use \footnotesize to ensure this complex matrix fits on the slide.
  \footnotesize
  \[X = S \begin{bmatrix} P & 0 \\ 0 & Q \end{bmatrix} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|ccc|c} - \frac{i}{2} I_r & 0 & 0 & F & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & i I_v & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0_{k-r-v} & 0 & 0 & 0 & C_3 \\ \hline - \frac{3}{4} F^{-1} & 0 & 0 & \frac{i}{2} I_r & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -i I_t & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0_{m-k-r-t} & C_6 \\ \hline 0 & 0 & D_3 & 0 & 0 & D_6 & W \\ \end{array} \right] \begin{bmatrix} P^{-1} & 0 \\ 0 & Q^{-1} \end{bmatrix} S^{-1}\]
  where $i D_3 C_3 = i D_6 C_6$, and other parameters ($S, P, Q, F, \dots$) are defined as in the theorem.
  \end{block}

  \vfill
  \textbf{Key takeaway:} The structure is complex but completely characterized. The off-diagonal blocks $F$ and its inverse are responsible for the non-commuting solutions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Concrete 3x3 Example: Setup}
  Let's make the abstract solution concrete. We will build the simplest non-trivial, non-commuting solution.
  \vfill
  \textbf{1. Construct A:} We need a 3x3 matrix with eigenvalues from $\{i, -i, 0\}$. The simplest is:
  \[ A = \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -i & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
  \vfill
  \textbf{2. Choose Parameters for X:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item To make it non-commuting, we need the parameter $r > 0$. Let's choose the simplest case: $\mathbf{r=1}$.
    \item This means the block $F$ is a 1x1 invertible matrix. Let's choose $\mathbf{F = [1]}$.
    \item The formula dictates $G = -\frac{3}{4}F^{-1} = [-\frac{3}{4}]$.
    \item For simplicity, we set all other free parameters to zero ($v=0, t=0, C_i=0, D_i=0, W=0$).
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Concrete 3x3 Example: The Result}
  Plugging our simple parameters into the general formula yields a clean, concrete solution for $X$.
  \begin{block}{The Resulting Solution X}
  \[ X = \begin{pmatrix} -i/2 & 1 & 0 \\ -3/4 & i/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
  \end{block}
  This matrix is constructed to be a solution. Now, let's explicitly verify the key properties.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Concrete 3x3 Example: Verification}
  \textbf{1. Is it non-commuting?} Let's check the products $AX$ and $XA$:
    \[ AX = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & i & 0 \\ 3i/4 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \neq \quad XA = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -i & 0 \\ -3i/4 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
    They do not commute, so this is a non-trivial solution.
    \vfill
  \textbf{2. Does it satisfy the YBME?}
    A quick calculation confirms that:
    \[ AXA = \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & i & 0 \\ 3i/4 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} A = \begin{pmatrix} i/2 & 1 & 0 \\ -3/4 & -i/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
    \[ XAX = X \begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & -i & 0 \\ -3i/4 & 1/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} i/2 & 1 & 0 \\ -3/4 & -i/2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
    The equation $AXA=XAX$ holds.
\end{frame}

\section{Generalization and Application}

\begin{frame}{Generalizing the Structure: $A^3 = tA$}
  This successful method can be generalized. Consider the annihilating polynomial:
  \[ p(x) = x^3 - tx = x(x - \sqrt{t})(x + \sqrt{t}) \]
  As long as we know that $t \neq 0$ it is easy to see that:
  \[ \lambda^2 - \lambda\mu + \mu^2 = 3t \neq 0 \]
  Hence we can construct all solutions as above.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Further Generalization}
  The logical next step is to consider higher powers of $A$.
  We can consider the following annihilating polynomial:
  \[ p(x) = x^k - xt = x(x^{k - 1} - t) \]
  This gives us the following two cases.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Generalization: Case 1 ($t \neq 0$)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $t \neq 0$, the roots of $x^{k-1} - t$ are the $(k-1)$-th roots of $t$. These are all distinct from each other and from 0.
    \item The polynomial $p(x)$ has $k$ distinct roots.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{block}{Structural Theorem}
    For $t \neq 0$, any matrix $A$ satisfying $A^k = tA$ is \textbf{diagonalizable}. Its spectrum is a subset of $\{0, \text{the } (k-1)\text{-th roots of } t\}$.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Generalization: Case 2 ($t = 0$)}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $t = 0$, the equation becomes $A^k = 0$.
    \item The matrix $A$ is \textbf{nilpotent}.
    \item The annihilating polynomial is $p(x) = x^k$, which has a repeated root at 0.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{alertblock}{Important Distinction}
    A non-zero nilpotent matrix is \textbf{never diagonalizable}. This case requires entirely different tools.
  \end{alertblock}
    \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The YBME for nilpotent matrices is an active area of research.
    \item Solutions have been fully classified for the simple cases $A^2=0$ and $A^3=0$. \cite{nilpotent2, nilpotent3}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Future Research}

\begin{frame}{The Research Frontier: Non-Commuting Solutions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The commuting case for diagonalizable matrices is well-understood. \cite{diagonalizable}
    \item The real challenge is finding \textbf{non-commuting solutions}.
    \item The proof of the theorem we used is very specific to 3 eigenvalues and is hard to generalize.
  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  \textbf{New Strategy:} Instead of generalizing the proof, let's generalize the \textit{problem setup} using our structural theorem.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Research Landscape (1/2): A Proven Method}
  The literature provides a clear path forward: classify solutions based on the minimal polynomial of $A$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A successful paper on quadrapotent matrices ($A^4=A$) used a powerful block-matrix method \cite{quadrapotent}.
    \item \textbf{The Method:} Treat $X$ as a $2 \times 2$ block matrix and solve the resulting system of four coupled matrix equations.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{block}{Strength of this Approach}
    This method is exhaustive. When it can be carried out, it yields a \textit{complete} classification of all solutions for a given minimal polynomial.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Research Landscape (2/2): The Limitation}
  While powerful, the block-matrix method has a critical bottleneck.
  \begin{alertblock}{The Challenge: Exploding Complexity}
  The complexity of the coupled equation system explodes as the number of distinct eigenvalues in the minimal polynomial increases.
  \end{alertblock}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This is precisely why the most complex cases in the $A^4=A$ paperâ€”those with three or four distinct non-zero eigenvaluesâ€”were left as open problems.
    \item This reveals the frontier of the current research: our methods are strong for simple spectra, but break down as the algebraic complexity grows.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My Research Proposal (1/3): The Core Insight}
  My work on the structure of $A^k=A$ provides a map of these minimal polynomials. The first step is to identify the genuinely new problems.
  \vfill
  \textbf{Observation:} The core difficulty is the structure of the minimal polynomial, not just the power $k$.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item For example, if a matrix $A$ satisfies $A^3=A$, it automatically satisfies $A^5=A$, since:
      \[A^5 = A^3 \cdot A^2 = A \cdot A^2 = A^3 = A\]
      \item This means that simply increasing $k$ can lead to redundant cases we already understand.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My Research Proposal (2/3): The Guiding Hypothesis}
  To find novel structures, we must isolate cases that cannot be reduced to simpler ones.
  \vfill
  \textbf{Hypothesis:} The first truly novel, unsolved cases appear when $k-1$ is a prime number.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item This is because the new eigenvaluesâ€”the primitive $(k-1)$-th roots of unityâ€”introduce a new, irreducible algebraic structure.
      \item When $k-1$ is prime, these new roots cannot be expressed in terms of roots from lower-order cases. This avoids the "contamination" from problems we have already solved.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{My Research Proposal (3/3): The Concrete Plan}
  My plan is to apply the proven block-matrix method to the first of these truly novel cases.
  \vfill
  \begin{itemize}
      \item The case $k=4$ ($k-1=3$) is the next frontier after my $A^3=-A$ work.
      \item The next genuinely new prime case is $k=6$ ($k-1=5$).
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{block}{Immediate Goal}
  Tackle some minimal polynomials dividing $p(x) = x(x^5-1)$. From here I am interested in seeing if I could solve a case for a general family of minimal polynomials, resulting in some non-commuting solutions for any $k$-potent matrix.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Broader Questions: The Geometry of the Solution Space}
  My primary goal is to find new non-commuting solutions. However, finding a non-commuting solution is just the first step. A deeper question is understanding the structure of the solution space it belongs to.
  \vfill
  Using the transformation $X' = f(X)Xf(X)^{-1}$ from my advisors' work [\citeauthor{intrinsic-structure}, \citeyear{intrinsic-structure}], we know solutions exist in continuous, path-connected families.
  \vfill
  \begin{alertblock}{An Open Question for Discussion}
  For the \textit{known} non-commuting solutions from the $A^4=A$ paper, can we determine if they all belong to a single solution family, connected by some function $f$? Or do they represent fundamentally distinct, disconnected families of solutions?
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

% \begin{frame}{Other open Questions for Discussion}
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item What algebraic methods are best suited for the nilpotent case ($A^k=0$)? This has been answer for $k = 2$ and $k = 3$. \cite{nilpotent2}\cite{nilpotent3}
%     \item How does the geometry of the roots of unity on the complex plane influence the structure of the solution set for $X$?
%     \item Are there other polynomial constraints on $A$ that yield similarly tractable, structured solutions?
